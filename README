Flux UI Framework

A lightweight alternative to Flex. Somewhere between Keith Peter's excellent MinimalComps and Flex.

Flux is designed to be much easier to style and extend than Flex, but you lose some of the deeper features of Flex.
If you've used Flex, you should be right at home.

Features :-

Small (~120K).

A well rounded set of controls, including
	PropertyInspector
	List and Tree (including drag and drop)
	Containers (HBox, VBox, Panel)
	Buttons (Toggle, Checkbox, Radio
	Viewstacks (TabNavigator)
	MenuBar
	ComboxBox
	Slider
	NumericStepper
	TextArea
	TextInput
	NumberInput
	ColorPicker
	Tooltips
	ProgressBar

Simple styling mechanism 
	Skin is provided via exported symbol SWC from flash.
	Skins are 'baked' into a component when created - no dynamic changing allowed.

Includes a deserializer to turn mxml-style declarative syntax into nested component instances at run-time. 
CursorManager
Component-level focus management
Proportional layout support (100% height/width)
Simple binding mechanism
ArrayCollection (serves as the basis of all dataproviders).


There are currently two examples showing most features (a sandbox and a simple code/design view app).
This project is being actively developed fixed while integrating into a large, GUI heavy app.
